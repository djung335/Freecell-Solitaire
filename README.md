# Freecell-Solitaire

This project is a Java implementation of Freecell Solitaire. Some notes:
- It uses the MVC design pattern to organize the functionality into distinct areas (rules + functionality, view). 
- Testing has been implemented through Junit  
- This implementation works through the console, and allows the player to play by typing commands.
